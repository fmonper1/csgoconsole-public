## What is the digital vibrance

Using Digital Vibrance (NVIDIA) or Saturation (AMD) in your graphic card driver can add an additional blast to your gaming experience due to more colourful images being output to your monitor.

Digital Vibrance/Saturation might give you an advantage in games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, as it will ease spotting enemies in the game.

## Using VibranceGUI

VibranceGUI is a small piece of software that allows us to set different levels of Vibrance for our games without messing with the Vibrance of Windows.

It also sets the digital vibrance **only** for the programs we want (only games, not our desktop or browser) and we can set it to run onnce we boot our computer.

To set up VibranceGUI for CSGO we have to open the program and click on the `Add manually` button. Then we just have to navigate to our Steam folder and find the csgo.exe file and select it.

Once we've manually added CSGO into VibranceGUI, click on the CSGO icon and a settings window will pop-up. Here we just adjust the slider to the level of vibrance we desire (I use 100% but the value you use may depend on your screen's settings)

Once we've done this, make sure VibranceGUI is running and open CSGO. You will immediately notice a difference in the colours of the game.
