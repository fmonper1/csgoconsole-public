## Disable full screen optimizations

By default in Windows10, the OS will try to "optimize" the game's performance. This is **not recommended**.

To disable this navigate to `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive` > right-click on the CS:GO icon > Properties and enable the `Disable fullscreen optimizations` option.

## Increase sound of footsteps

We can improve the sounds we hear in-game by turning on Loudness Equalization. This will allow you to hear close sounds quieter and those that are far away louder.

This will help you pin-point your enemies when they step even when your shooting.

To enable this option:

1. Right-click the speaker icon on your task bar
2. Click on `Sounds`
3. Navigate to `Playback`
4. Right-click on the playback device you use in CS:GO
5. Navigate to `Enhancements`
6. Enable the `Loudness equalization` option
7. Click apply
8. Ez frags

## Enable stretched resolutions

<div class="flex flex-wrap">
<div class="w-full sm:w-7/12 pr-2">

Some players might prefer to play on stretched resolutions either for achieving higher FPS or to see the enemy player model a bit thicker.

Whichever is your case, you will need to enable the re-scaling of the games resolution in your NVIDIA control panel or AMD Adrenaline. This guide is for NVIDIA cards but the process is similar for both.

1. Open up the NVIDIA control panel
2. Navigate to 'Adjust desktop size and position'
3. Select `full-screen scaling`
