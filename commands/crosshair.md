# Crosshair Commands

The crosshair is and indicator on the middle of the screen that shows what we're aiming at and where are bullets should go (most of the time at least).

As with most of the things in CSGO we can customize it to our liking. You can find below a table with all the available commands to customize your crosshair in-game.
